# React Lab – Component Library

## Overview

In this lab, I built a small, reusable UI component library using React + TypeScript. I practiced creating strongly-typed components, handling props correctly, composing components together, and documenting my work. 

 
## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

* Create reusable React components using TypeScript interfaces.
* Implement proper prop typing, including optional props and children.
* Use component composition to build larger UI pieces from smaller ones.
* Apply TypeScript best practices for React development.
* Document components with clear interfaces and examples.

----------

## Description

Your task is to implement and test a collection of reusable UI components. These components will be part of your company’s internal component library, meaning they must be flexible, consistent, and type-safe.

You will:

* Build components with well-typed props.
* Validate and handle different prop combinations.
* Compose components together and demonstrate usage.
* Document your components with comments and examples.

This lab focuses on:

* Component creation
* TypeScript interfaces
* Prop handling
* Component composition
